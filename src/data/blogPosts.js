        content: `React Hooks have revolutionized how we write React components. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore useState, useEffect, and custom hooks. 
    
    Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class component. They make your code more readable and reusable.
    
    The useState hook is the most commonly used hook. It allows you to add state to functional components. Here's a simple example:
    
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    
    The useEffect hook lets you perform side effects in functional components. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined in React classes.
    
    Custom hooks are a powerful feature that lets you extract component logic into reusable functions. They're just JavaScript functions whose names start with "use" and that may call other hooks.`,
